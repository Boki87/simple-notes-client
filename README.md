## Simple Notes

This project was built with the intention to learn **Laravel 8** and the **Vue 3** composition api + **Tailwind CSS**.

As mentioned the backend is a Laravel 8 REST API

Its basically a simple CRUD app with added auth functionality:

- Login
- Register
- Google login

Plus there is a small section where you can update your avatar picture which is uploaded to **Amazon S3**
